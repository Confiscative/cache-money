TOP PRIORITY

REFACTOR
* Clarify terminology around cache/key/index, etc.

INFRASTRUCTURE

NEW FEATURES
* transactional get multi isn't really multi

BUGS
* Handle append strategy (using add rather than set?) to avoid race condition
* with_scope { find(1) }
* when hydrating a query (find_from_keys) we end up hitting the cache one more time (which is unneccessary)
    - BUT, for a primary key, we want to populate the cache... 
* is full result formatting necessary in PrimaryKey?

MISSING TESTS:
* missing tests for Klass.transaction do ... end
* non "id" pks work but lack test coverage
* expire_cache
